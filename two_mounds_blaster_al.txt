>TWO MOUNDS A COMMON DOSSHOUSE
>by Asylum V Loder

>In number and each wore a hat something fierce orange
>But the way stood lined with inhabitants in which stirred
little chunks of raw brown clumsy, if not purposeless
>This was sound
>So jog in the chimney, occluded one
>It may sound easy enough but for sense of a store of sooty
bloody spittle formed the path you're tempting as they sat in
their aformentioned idiot and his cage is no reason to stop
and save for their gums
>Your bag also contained a pumpkin mask in those days
>And a hand-written price list titled Pay Scale for Pumpkin
which listed dollar figures along with acts like "allowing
pumpkin to lotion you"
>"heartbreak often makes you squirt"
>"go on off admiring some pond lilies that had a wagon"
>"Pop you-know-what"
>Then
>To relive don't go on suffering a grasslike outer covering in
such blatant disregard of physical chance to limit any of
this looking like a heathen creature of an era that ended
just as I reached my phenomenal gift of "sipping like a bee"
>Let them save for their own gums is what I say that the
world would be to him intended to hang out loose in the
front of the world below that with elbows and the stroll
>That great old dance craze from the 50s ou asperse
>Crouched silently and stood in for the guest-room sewing
room at the foot of the bed
>It's how a dress could be hidden inside another dress
>Now have to brood proudly complete would be behind his foot
sticks through tan in the pigeon coop avuncluar
>Not the whirring up of everyone but of each one
>Even dropped to the left empty among flames
>And every ten hs or so time to get to cook and prepare
a bat
>Contaminated, disturbed by and drawn to the pointillist
method
>I suppose this message started wuth the rather banal idea of
marrying Lizzy Borden and I had read Dante before Aquinas
>That ruminary rinsing in the water closet
>The smell in approaching such a set-up blindfolded sacri-
fices much of the fun to be had which accompanies deafness
>A post like a peg - find the neglected a long head lick
that hers alone in a gesture strangely unlike a stumbling
among a hole in the ceiling where a few both must be tested
in the stern furnace of your halitosis and paint around the
bottom of it "the family stayed sick for the next three 
pumpkins"
>With flicting and vim
>Mouth to mouth and phone to phone
>Our floor plan could clay suburb
>Dull without they were poisoned
>Crinkly hair put his hand there
>Rimlands
